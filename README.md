# CSV Parser - webdev-challenge
This Laravel based application called CSV parser is for NRI Web Development Challenge.

- An attractive and a very simple front end using Bootstrap.
- MVC and OOP based readable and reusable code.
- Special care has been placed to make the application parse a CSV file without errors.
- The proudest implementation would be the backend controller code and the way CSV contents are handled.
